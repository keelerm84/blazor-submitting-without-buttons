# Submitting Without Buttons

This repository is a playground for potential solutions to a problem I'm
exploring in Blazor.

The goal is to have a simple form made up of a single textarea input with no
associated button.

The repository has multiple different attempts detailed for demo purposes. Run
the application with

```console
$ dotnet run
```

and check out the index page. It will detail each of the options available and
their relative trade offs.

Follow the original thread that prompted this repository on [Practical
ASP.NET](https://community.practicaldotnet.io/c/the-lounge/blazor-form-validation-without-submit-button).
