<h1>Submitting a form without a button</h1>

<p>
    This repository show cases various attempts to deal with a Blazor form that lacks a submit button. The goal is to
    have a single textarea which the user can submit via a Ctrl+Enter key combinaton. Validation errors should be shown
    to the user once they attempt to submit. I do not want errors to show up as they type.
</p>

        <a href="/edit-context-with-input-text-area">
            EditContextWithInputTextArea
        </a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This example makes use of an Edit Context and the built-in
            InputTextArea. It does not work as intended as the form fails to
            validate the model appropriately.
